* if we go the route of calling `project-scaffolder` within these, what should
  the object be named that provides the details normally found in `results`?
* higher-order scaffolder doesnt actually seem like an appropriate name for
  this. what would be more accurate? maybe i'm thinking more "high-level" than
  "higher-order"

{{THIS SECTION SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE RATIFICATION}}
